## How to play?

This is similar to rock, paper, scissors but it has extra hands, lizard and spock. It was played in *The Big Bang Theory*. 
There are five icons for a user and a computer. The user will have the opportunity to click on one of these icons to select his/her weapon. Then, there will be login that will allow the computer to make a random selection and it will evaluate which player won or a tie.
